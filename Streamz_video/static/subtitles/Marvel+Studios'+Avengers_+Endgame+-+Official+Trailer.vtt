WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.210
âªâª

00:00:04.461 --> 00:00:05.713
TONY STARK:
It seems like a thousand

00:00:05.714 --> 00:00:06.714
years ago...

00:00:07.716 --> 00:00:09.175
I fought my way out
of that cave...

00:00:10.426 --> 00:00:11.510
became Iron Man...

00:00:14.888 --> 00:00:16.015
realized I loved you...

00:00:20.562 --> 00:00:22.772
I know I said no more
surprises, but...

00:00:22.771 --> 00:00:26.233
I was really hoping to
pull off one last one.

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:31.030
PEGGY CARTER:
The world has changed.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.534
None of us can go back...

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:41.665
All we can
do is our best...

00:00:42.834 --> 00:00:45.170
and sometimes the
best that we can do...

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.298
is to start over.

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:55.847
âªâª

00:01:00.726 --> 00:01:02.728
THOR:
I saw all these people die.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.068
STEVE ROGERS:
I keep telling everybody

00:01:08.067 --> 00:01:09.027
they should move on...

00:01:11.445 --> 00:01:12.489
Some do...

00:01:13.156 --> 00:01:14.365
but not us.

00:01:17.868 --> 00:01:19.037
NATASHA ROMANOFF:
Even if there's a...

00:01:19.037 --> 00:01:20.038
small chance...

00:01:21.206 --> 00:01:22.248
we owe this...

00:01:23.957 --> 00:01:25.626
to everyone who's
not in this room

00:01:25.626 --> 00:01:26.543
to try.

00:01:30.673 --> 00:01:31.882
We will.

00:01:33.802 --> 00:01:34.969
STEVE ROGERS:
Whatever it takes.

00:01:37.096 --> 00:01:38.138
NEBULA:
Aaaaahhhh!

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.557
CLINT BARTON:
Whatever it takes.

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:42.811
NATASHA ROMANOFF:
Whatever it takes.

00:01:49.233 --> 00:01:50.275
TONY STARK:
Whatever it takes.

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:03.873
âªâª

00:02:19.722 --> 00:02:20.682
I like this one.
